# PlanarVisibility

Compute visibility graph for polygonal obstacles in the plane.

Also support line-shaped obstacles. Consider all points that are part of
obstacles, but allow subsequent addition of more points.

This has applications in motion planning, but also surveillance (see: [Art
gallery problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_gallery_problem)).
